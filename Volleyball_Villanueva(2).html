            <h2>Volleyball</h2>
            <p>I chose volleyball as my first and favorite sport because I see a lot of people playing
                volleyball back then and I was interested to try it, my idol in playing volleyball is 
                myself because I am proud of myself that I learned this sport, meet new people and go to 
                competitions. I was a provincial player back then when I was in grade 5, but because of 
                the pandemic, I wasn't able to go to the regionals.

            <h2>Frisbee</h2>
            <p>I chose frisbee as my second favorite sport because me and my friends go to the oval sometimes
                and play frisbee.
            </p>

            <h2>Badminton</h2>
            <p>My third fave sport is Badminton, I play badminton with friends if I am really bored
                and because it is fun to play with friends, it also benefits me because I can burn some
                calories along the playing duration.

        <section class="sport" id="sport4">
            <h2>Football</h2>
            <p>Last but definitely not the least, Football. I play football because it's attractive, cool
                and my cousins back in Antique convinced me to play the sport with them.
